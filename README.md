Full Source Code for Interactive Infographics

## DESCRIPTION
This is a completely free source code for "An Interactive Infographics", a webpage I developed using HTML and JavaScript. I made it for an infographics competition back in 2016, I won 3rd place in "interactive infographics" category. The page consists of the Indonesian Language as my first language. But overall, it's easy to use since the code is mostly English. Also, the data in the page is outdated (from year 2015 and 2016).

## HOW TO ENJOY
Before using this code, you gotta make sure you have your local server ready (such xampp or wamp), IDE (I use VSCode), git and composer installed on your computer.

1. Open your terminal in ```htdocs``` (if you use xampp) or ```www``` (if you use wamp)
2. Run this code to clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/khansasafira19/sk-interactive-infographics.git```
3. That's it, the app should run now. Access it on http://localhost/sk-interactive-infographics/
